	http://www.readytalk.com/webinar-series/events/how-start-non-profit-legal-and-practical-considerations-1108  


## Structure  

After reviewing the webinar, SocialGeeks will fit into the following structure.  
* 501(c)(3) Educational, Scientific and Charitable  
* Public Charity 509(a)(1) Receiving most of our money from gifts, grants and contributions.  

## Board, committees and officers  

	Be careful with board members as it is one of the things that is very hard to undo once it is done.  

* Board of Directors  
* Fundraising Committee, Budget and Finance Committee, Nominating Committee, Other: Ad Hoc or Program Committees  
* President: CEO, Executive Director  
* Vice Presidents: Asst. Directory Development, CFO, Asst. Director Finance, COO, Asst. Director Operations, Asst. Director Human Resources  

## Bylaws  
 
What constitues a quorum (meeting)?  
What happens to assets upon dissolution?  
* Donate to schools or does it need to be a non-profit?  

Show how board of directors can take an action and oversee the organization.  

Legal purpose statement (broad), not a mission or vision statement, not statement of goals and objectives.  State charitable, educational and scientific  

Self perpetuating board of directors, not a voting membership (specify this in bylaws)  

Restrictions on activities (conflict of interest)  
* As acting director and a voting board member I (Dan) cannot vote on my own salary.  The process for this needs to be laid out.  
* If we are accepting jobs from companies board members work for this process needs to be laid out as well.  

Personal liability, establish right of individual not to be sued by corporation.  This way people aren't afraid to join the board.
Indemnification (hold harmless selected classes of people)
* classes of people (directors, officers, employees, volunteers?)
* can affect insurance costs

## Articles of Incorporation  


## Form 1023  

	27 months from incorporation to submit 1023 (would like to do this much sooner)   

### Narrative statement of activities (part iv)  
-- This is where you sell yourself to the IRS, making your case for tax-exempt status
-- NOT: legal purpose statement, mission or vision statement (it is ok to use legal purpose as a start, but embelish upon that)
-- DO NOT: make judgements, opinion statements
-- DO: be specific, give who, what, when, where, why, how of your charitable activities
-- Good faith, not legally required to fulfill all activities and not limited to those activities  

### Proposed budgets (part ix)  
-- DO NOT: overestimate numbers, show large deficits or surpluses  
-- DO: refelct programmatic expenses outlined in statement of activities  
-- Not legally obligated to meet these amts (good faith).  
-- KISS  

No excessive lobbying activities.  We will want to support the EFF, will this cause an issue???  
International charity work, additional paperwork will be needed when we get to this point.
